## MLflow Labs

This project is a hands-on exploration of the **core APIs of MLflow Tracking**.  
It focuses on learning how to log experiments, register models, and load them for inference using the **MLflow fluent API**.

Through this project, I aim to practice and understand:

- How to log **parameters**, **metrics**, and **models**  
- The basics of the **MLflow fluent API**  
- How to **register a model** during logging  
- How to navigate the **MLflow UI** to view registered models  
- How to **load a logged model** for inference
