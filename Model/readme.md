### Purpose of the Model directory:

- This folder, a collection of MLflow artifacts, is created and stored in the Databricks workspace when we run the tracking_quickstart notebook.
- It contains artifacts that are produced by Databricks, such as the model and their dependencies.
- This ensures reproducibility of the model and allows us to easily deploy it in different environments.
